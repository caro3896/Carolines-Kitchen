You can easily customize granola too, so if you're low on one ingredient, don't worry about heading to the store - you can probably just use something else you have on hand. Easily swap nuts and seeds; don't have walnuts? Use pecans. No almonds? Try cashews. Same goes for seeds - sunflower seeds and pepitas are easily interchangeable.",
